Research Interests
======
During my previous years, I have spent time exploring my real interest and engaged in multiple research experiences focusing at machine unlearning, recommender systems, graph learning, bioinformatics, etc. Recently, my primary focus has been on delving into research concerning multimodal AI (with a particular focus on videoLLMs), and I have been fascinated by multimodal technologies and their applications truly fascinating. **_How can we equip multimodal systems with more efficient multimodal representation or interaction?_** This is the primary question I've been asking myself recently.
